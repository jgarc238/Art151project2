            Wake up!
        </h1>

        <p>
            You awaken from a deep sleep and with a throbbing headache.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            A man dressed in shadows approaches you and says
        </p>

        
        <p>
            Well, now that you're awake, I have a game for you.
        </p>

        <a href="Task1.html" class="Pass1"> Would you like to play?</a>
