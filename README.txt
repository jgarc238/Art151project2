Concept: You wake up in a dark room and are given choices by a mysterious figure. 
You will notice that once you complete the actual tasks that you still fail.
There are little things hidden around that you must click on that will give you the true ending
(true ending: it was actually a never ending nightmare and you have to somehow pull yourself out)
